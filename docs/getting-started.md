This will replace the internationalization of react-admin (It use [polyglot](http://airbnb.io/polyglot.js/)).

Instead, this will replace it with [react-intl](https://github.com/yahoo/react-intl)

Because of that, default messages provided by **react-admin** won't be compatible anymore.

This is why you must use this package to import the **react-intl** version of messages:


```bash
$ npm install @yeutech-lab/ra-language-intl --save
```

Visit [ra-language-intl](https://github.com/yeutech-lab/ra-language-intl) documentation to view available or add locale(s) translation(s).
